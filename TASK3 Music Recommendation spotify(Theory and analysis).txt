#AIM

The goal of such a recommendation system would be to provide personalized content by rightly identifying what the user wants. 
This means that computers will have to think the way humans do; analysing each of the userâ€™s last choices to predict what they would like in the future. 
As we have already seen, whenever there is a need for a machine to mimic human behavior, we have to utilize Machine Learning techniques.
Therefore, in this project, we will be relying on Machine Learning and Neural Networking techniques to build the ultimate music recommendation system.

#PROCEDURE

1.Using the KAGGLE global datasets we import the spotify music data with approximately 200 entries
2.Using pandas library we read the csv file
3.Using seaborn we can get the clear visualisation of the data 
4.Also using corr() we can get the correlation coefficient against every column in the table 
5.Using kMeans module from sklearn we fit the dataset and prediction is condidered
6.At last the user needs to enter any name of the song present in the data and thus the ML algorith return the playlist of 10 recommended songs
