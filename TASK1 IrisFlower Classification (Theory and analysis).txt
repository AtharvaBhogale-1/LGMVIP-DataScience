Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, 
Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, 
‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

The key features used to complete ML Algorithms for Iris Dataset :  

##Libraries used 
  1.sklearn
  2.pandas
  3.numpy
  4.seaborn

##STEPS

1.Loading the dataset as a csv file, Reading the file using pandas library
2.Visualisation of the dataset using pairplots, heatmap ,corr()
3.Spliting the given dataset into test,train and validation 
4.Training the Model using sklearn's Support vector machine algorithm
5.Finding the R^2 score,precision,recall ,f1 scores,confusion matrix on the testing data  we can acertain the perfectness of the model 
6.The ML model is  now be tested on random data values and then desired outcomes are verified with true results
